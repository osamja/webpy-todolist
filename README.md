==============

My first Git repository. To-Do-List application from web.py tutorial

I'm just trying to learn some programming to stay alive.




Anyways.. this program is from the webpy.org tutorial about databases. 

It's a basic to-do-list web application 

that allows the user to add items to a unordered list and then saves each

entry to the database. I configured this with MySQL and the server will 

run on your computer server.
